# Welcome!
## To My Portfolio Webstite
As an aspiring developer, the purpose of this site is to showcase the skills and knowledge, that I have accumulated whilst attending a full stack developer bootcamp by Coder Academy. What I would like to achieve is a demonstration, to potential future employees and/or clients, what I can offer to their projects.

## Designing & Building The Site
The design goal of my website was to make a simple site to allow for me to focus more on a pleasant user experience for my primary audience, future employees and/or clients. I wanted the site to be responsive, dynamic and have user friendly features. I also wanted to challenge myself into designing the site that was not heavily dependent on media queires or javascript code. 
Here was my design process:
